# üì± Android SDK Deep Dive ‚Äì Kotlin Playground

This project is a personal playground to explore and deepen my knowledge of the **Android SDK** using **Kotlin** and **Jetpack** components.

The goal is to go beyond the high-level libraries and dive into the core system-level functionalities provided by Android. Through small, focused modules and real-world examples, I aim to strengthen my understanding of native APIs and develop better technical intuition as a mobile developer.

## üîç Topics Covered

- Activity & Fragment Lifecycle
- Permissions handling (runtime & background)
- Services: Foreground, Bound & Background
- Sensors (Accelerometer, Gyroscope)
- Media (Audio & Screen Recording via MediaProjection)
- Notifications & Notification Channels
- Storage access (MediaStore, File API, Scoped Storage)
- Location services
- Camera (CameraX, Camera2)
- Android Debug Bridge (ADB) & Logcat exploration

## üß™ Why this project?

As I grow in my Android journey, I want to move closer to the metal ‚Äî understanding **how things work under the hood**.  
This repo will serve as a reference for myself and others looking to explore the Android SDK in a **practical, modular and well-documented** way.

## üöß Status

Ongoing. More modules and features will be added progressively.
